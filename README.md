 Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Farzad And My Friends Usually Call me Mr.Glass :))



 I've been Learning Web Development And Doing Freelance Projects since 2020
I've Been Working On Both Front-end And Back-end Sides.

My Main Favorite Frameworks Are Js Ones (VueJs,NodeJs,NestJs) But I Have Several Projects Using Django And Golang(Fiber And Gorm)
I needed to Use Koa.js and Golang Jet For Some Projects Too. 
I Mainly Use Mysql and Sqlite For my Projects But Coding With PostgreSql and Redis Was Nessecery Sometimes So I Have A Familiarity With Them

I'm Currently Working On Several Projects (Mostly back-end)


Have Fun And Enjoy My Github!!!
